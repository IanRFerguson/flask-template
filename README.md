# Flask Web Application Template

This repo contains source code to provide a baseline template for new Flask projects.

## Navigation

* Update components of the app in the local `app/` subdirectory
* Add and update HTML files to `app/templates/`
* Add and update static files (CSS and JavaScript) in `app/static/`
* Add additional routes in `app/utilities/routes.py`
  * The Flask blueprint is already written for you, so all you need to do is add the `bp.route()` decorator to your route function
